# Machine-learning_coupon-redemption

## Problem background
Itâ€™s important for merchants to send coupons to customers effectively. Unwanted coupons can make customers frustrated and also unnecessarily increase the marketing expense. Given the data of customers and merchants, try to predict the probability that the customer would redeem the coupon in a certain range of time. The evaluation metric is the average AUC value for coupons.

## Data description
off_train: [user_id, merchant_id, coupon_id, discount_rate, distance, date_received, date]  
off_test: [user_id, merchant_id, coupon_id, discount_rate, distance, date_received]
